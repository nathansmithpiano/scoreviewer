/* Notes: 
@media width/height uses CSS pixels, so ppi not an issue?
However, will this force scaling to low-res images for high-res devices?
Ideally, render each line as close to its physical size would be on a printed page

Physical = width / 96 * pixel-ratio
Physical = calc(width / 96 * -webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio)
